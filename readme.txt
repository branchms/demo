I'm a text file and I'm super fun.

I'm a new line a text because editing is even more fun the second time around.

here is yet another line of change because we don't like to have to use VIM commands during a commit

I just can't believe how much fun these changes would be.  Especially this being the 4th change n all.

This change is being done on the new Branch MyBranch

Here is what's being called change 7, Here goes nothing.

Here is a line to cause a merge conflict
